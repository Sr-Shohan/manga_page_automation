#  UI Automation

This project is a demonstration of how I have implemented end-to-end testing using Selenium WebDriver and Pytest framework. I have learned how to use these tools and applied my knowledge to create a test suite that can run tests against a web application.


The project uses Pytest as a test runner, which allows me to write test functions using the built-in assertion library. I have also used Selenium WebDriver to automate browser interactions and simulate user actions.
